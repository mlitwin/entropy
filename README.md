# Entropy

## Circle

Particles moving in a circle:

- Discrete space
- Discrete velocity

Imagine sensors around the circle

- Can't tell velocity, only density
- Have a certain sensitively - need a quanta before registering
- Have a certain precision - pick up neighbors at some distance

Simulate - calculate probability space (it's periodic), and find time-asymmetric measures.

## Simulation

./circle -n 2000 -v 30 -p 1
